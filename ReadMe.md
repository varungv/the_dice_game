# The Game of Dice
**This is command line multiplayer game written in pure python. <br>**

The "Game of Dice" is a multiplayer game where N players roll a 6 faced dice in a round-robin
fashion. Each time a player rolls the dice their points increase by the number (1 to 6) achieved
by the roll.

As soon as a player accumulates M points they complete the game and are assigned a rank.
Remaining players continue to play the game till they accumulate at least M points. The game
ends when all players have accumulated at least M points.

    Python Version: 3.xx+
    Required packages: None [All the required packages is available in python] <br>

### Rules of the game
- The order in which the users roll the dice is decided randomly at the start of the game.
- If a player rolls the value "6" then they immediately get another chance to roll again and move
ahead in the game.
- If a player rolls the value "1" two consecutive times then they are forced to skip their next turn
as a penalty.

### Implementation Details
- Implement a standalone program in your favorite programming language which takes the
values N (number of players) and M (points of accumulate) as command line arguments.
- Name the players as Player-1 to Player-N and randomly assign the order in which they
will roll the dice.
- When it's the turn for Player-X to roll the dice prompt a message like “Player-3 its your
turn (press ‘r’ to roll the dice)
- Randomly simulate a dice roll, display the points achieved and add the points to the
user’s score.
- Print the current rank table which displays the points of all users and their rank after
each roll.
- If the user gets another chance because they rolled a ‘6’ or they are penalised because
they rolled ‘1’ twice consecutively then print appropriate message on standard output to
inform the user.
- If a user completes the game, print an appropriate message on the output displaying
their rank.
